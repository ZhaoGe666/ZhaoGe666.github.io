    <h1>Hi thereüëã! I am Xiaozhao Liu (ÂàòÂ∞èÊò≠)</h1>
    <div class="greeting">
        <p>Welcome to my home page!</p>
        <p>After three years of master's study and a year of independent research as a research assistant, I have confirmed my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_theory_of_love" target="_blank">passion, dedication, and commitment</a> to the field of AI & brain.</p>
        <p>Artificial intelligence has achieved remarkable progress in recent years, particularly in multi-modal models (convergence of representations) and generative models (emergence and hallucination). This progress makes me increasingly skeptical about the concept of human free will‚Äîit may just be wishful thinking.</p>
        <p>We might simply be more complex multi-modal models trained with higher-level end-to-end rewards (such as survival). Emotions, motivations, and even awareness may have evolved to serve this singular purpose.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, I believe this is the best era to uncover the secrets of human intelligence, and the coming five years present the perfect opportunity to apply scaling laws in the direction of brain decoding.</p>
        <p>I am actively applying for Ph.D. programs in this field.</p>
        <p>I will also continually update this site to share my thoughts through blog posts, showcase my research, and contribute to the open-source community.</p>
